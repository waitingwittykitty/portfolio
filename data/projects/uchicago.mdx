The GDC Data Portal is a robust data-driven platform that allows cancer researchers and bioinformaticians to search and download cancer data for analysis.

You can learn more about it [on its official documentation](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Data_Portal/Users_Guide/Getting_Started) and the [User Guide PDF file](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Data_Portal/PDF/Data_Portal_UG.pdf).

I joined the frontend team of the GDC Data Portal and implemented the ability to create charts using Plotly.js and D3.js and export them to SVG, PNG, JSON, and TSV. Also, by customizing various components of Mantine, the usability of Portal is enhanced.
